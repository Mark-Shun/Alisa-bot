# Alisa Discord Bot

Welcome to the repository for the Alisa Discord bot. Due to having lost the previous iteration of the bot, and discovering that it doesn't compile/run on some IoT devices (Raspberry Pi) in this case, I decided to start this little project.

## Features

- Can connect to Discord's developer bot service
- Appointing/removing roles by standard members
- Alisa responses in chat
- Error handling


## Planned Features
- Admin/mod chat tools to change role handling

## Installation

Alisa bot uses the Discord.py API wrapper.
Due to this to run Alisa bot you need two things: python3 and discord.py

```bash
  install python
  install pip
```

Go into the desired terminal (e.x: command prompt)

```bash
  pip install discord.py
```
    
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Mark-Shun/Alisa_bot.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Alisa_bot
```

Run the Alisa bot (note: make sure that Python3 is run, some terminals require entering python3 instead of just python)

```bash
  python Alisa.py
```


## Appendix
While tiny in scope, I hope it will be useful for the Discord server.
